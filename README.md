Here’s a sample `README.md` file for your Flutter app that uses TensorFlow Lite for exercise selection:

---

# Exercise Selector App

This is a Flutter application that allows users to select exercises based on difficulty levels and exercise types. The app loads a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model to make predictions using input data from a CSV file. 

## Features
- Dropdown menus to select exercise difficulty level and type (e.g., Cardio, Full Body, Warmup).
- Runs inference using a TensorFlow Lite model for predicting outputs based on CSV input data.
- Displays selected values and model output dynamically.
- CSV file contains metadata about exercises (e.g., Title, Description, Type, Body Part, Equipment, and Level).

## Tech Stack
- **Flutter**: For the frontend and UI development.
- **TensorFlow Lite**: For running the machine learning model inferences.
- **CSV File Handling**: To read exercise data from a CSV file and use it as input for the model.

## Requirements

- Flutter SDK: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- TensorFlow Lite Flutter Plugin
- Dart SDK

### Plugins Used:
1. `tflite_flutter`: For TensorFlow Lite integration.
2. `csv/csv.dart`: To load and process CSV files.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prashanna0013/boom.git
cd exercise_selector_app
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
Run the following command in the project root to get the Flutter packages:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Set up the TensorFlow Lite model:
- Copy your `beginner.tflite` model file into the `assets` folder of the project.
- Make sure to add the model path to `pubspec.yaml` under the `assets` section:
```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/beginner.tflite
    - assets/exercises.csv
```

### 4. Add your CSV file:
- Place your `new_data (5).csv` file in the `assets` folder, which contains the input data for the TensorFlow Lite model. This CSV should have the format:
  ```
  S.no,Title,Desc,Type,BodyPart,Equipment,Level
  0,Partner plank band row,... 
  ```

### 5. Run the App:
- Use the command below to run the app:
```bash
flutter run
```

## App Structure

```plaintext
lib/
│
├── main.dart                    # Main entry point of the application
├── rlmodel.dart                  # TensorFlow Lite model loading and inference handling
├── exerciseselector.dart         # UI for selecting exercise options
├── device_page.dart              # Main UI page with exercise options
├── assets/                       # Folder containing model and CSV file
│   ├── beginner.tflite           # Pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model
│   └── new_data (5).csv            # CSV file containing exercise data
```

### TensorFlow Service (`rlmodel.dart`)
- Loads the `beginner.tflite` TensorFlow Lite model.
- Provides a method `runModel` to run inference on input data.
- Uses input extracted from the CSV file to feed into the model.

### UI Flow
1. The user selects the exercise difficulty and type using dropdown menus.
2. Pressing the "Run Model" button loads the input from the CSV file and runs inference using the TensorFlow Lite model.
3. The app displays the model's output below the button.

## Sample CSV File

Here is a small sample of how the `new_data (5).csv` file should look:

```csv
S.no,Title,Desc,Type,BodyPart,Equipment,Level
0,Partner plank band row,The partner plank band row is an abdominal exercise ...,Strength,Abdominals,Bands,Intermediate
1,Banded crunch isometric hold,The banded crunch isometric hold is an exercise targeting the ...,Strength,Abdominals,Bands,Intermediate
2,FYR Banded Plank Jack,The banded plank jack is a variation on the plank ...,Strength,Abdominals,Bands,Intermediate
3,Crunch,The crunch is a popular core exercise targeting the ...,Strength,Abdominals,None,Beginner
```
